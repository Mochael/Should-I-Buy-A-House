# Should I Buy a House?

This app is meant to help you determine whether or not buying a house is right for you. 

Some caveats:
- This does not calculate income tax on your invested money, even though it does take property tax into account for purchasing a house.
- Assumes property tax is stagnant over time and based on the value when you initially purchased the home.
- This assumes that the rate of growth in rent prices is the same as the annual property value growth rate.
- This also neglects maintanance costs for the house you buy
